      <title>In the Matter of the Request to Release Certain Pretrial Detainees</title>
      <description>Through this application, the Court considers a request by the Office of the Public Defender and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey that seeks relief relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the suspension of in-person criminal jury trials on defendants who have been detained pretrial.  Specifically, the applicants seek:  (1) the release of all defendants detained for six months or longer whose most serious charge is a second-degree offense or lower, with an opportunity for the State to object in individual cases and seek to justify continued detention under an enhanced burden of proof; and (2) new detention hearings for all defendants detained for six months or longer who are charged with a first-degree offense and entitled to a presumption of release.</description>
